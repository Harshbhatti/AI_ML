       "       'Subject neon retreat ho ho ho  we  re around to that most wonderful time of the year    neon leaders retreat time  i know that this time of year is extremely hectic  and that it  s tough to think about anything past the holidays  but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1  and that  s what i  d like you to think about for a minute  on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester  the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5  6  but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week  we  re going to change the date to the following weekend  january 12  13  now comes the part you need to think about  i think we all agree that it  s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester  but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids  etc  so  brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend  and then you can let me know which you prefer  the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we  ve done the past several years  this year we could go to the heartland country inn  www   com  outside of brenham  it  s a nice place  where we  d have a 13  bedroom and a 5  bedroom house side by side  it  s in the country  real relaxing  but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here  we can golf  shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham  eat dinner together at the ranch  and spend time with each other  we  d meet on saturday  and then return on sunday morning  just like what we  ve done in the past  the second option would be to stay here in houston  have dinner together at a nice restaurant  and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening  this might be easier  but the trade off would be that we wouldn  t have as much time together  i  ll let you decide  email me back with what would be your preference  and of course if you  re available on that weekend  the democratic process will prevail   majority vote will rule  let me hear from you as soon as possible  preferably by the end of the weekend  and if the vote doesn  t go your way  no complaining allowed  like i tend to do   have a great weekend  great golf  great fishing  great shopping  or whatever makes you happy  bobby',\n",
